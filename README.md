I'm a software enthusiast who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include,PHP ReactJS, Fullstack (JavaScript, MEAN, MERN, Vuejs, APIs + Markup) and Laravel. I recently was selected to be an inaugural GitHub Star 🌟 based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the Tech ecosystem led me to found Iqbotics India, a company for AI and Robotics design & development.
